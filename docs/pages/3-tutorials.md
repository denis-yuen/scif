# Getting Started

We provide several tutorials for getting started with the scientific filesystem. If you haven't read about the [goals](/scif/goals) or [specification](/scif/specification) for the standard (and are interested) you might do that first.

## Quick Starts
If you want to quickly familarize with a pre-built example scientific filesystem, check out our *[container quickstart](/scif/tutorial-quick-start)* or *[really quick start](/scif/tutorial-really-quick-start)* to pull a pre-bulit Docker and/or Singularity image and start using it! Or if you are more visual, just watch an asciinema:

## Preview and Install
Here we will start with a scientific filesystem recipe, preview what it produces, and then install a scientific filesystem. This is likely the most common use case. [preview and install](/scif/tutorial-preview-install).

## Running Commands
The scientific filesystem comes with the expected commands to run, exec, inspect, start a shell, an interactive python shell,  and a new syntax to easily distinguish an environment variable (introducing the beautiful `[e]` to say that `[e]MYVAR` = `$MYVAR`). Want to give it a spin? Read more about how to  [run commands](/scif/tutorial-commands).
